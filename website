        <h1>DDoouubblleettoowwnn</h1>
        <p>
            The sick prankster Dubius Dublius, during the founding of singletown, told its founders that there was a giant mirror in the ocean to the west of the island.
            Since there was a similar looking island to the west, they beleived him. 
            In order to keep the prank going, he has to make sure everything built in singletown is also made in DDoouubblleettoowwnn. 
            Unfortunatly, singletown is a very efficient town and changes very often, meaning him and his builders have to build quickly.
